/**
 * THE ENTITLEMENT BOUNDARY — Tech Spec §40.
 *
 * "The Academy should NOT trust a frontend success message as proof of
 *  payment. The actual payment provider webhook/server verification should
 *  determine whether an entitlement is created."
 *
 * This route is the ONLY path that creates an entitlement with source
 * 'purchase'. The browser cannot create one: `mission_entitlements` has a
 * single RLS policy and it is `for select`.
 *
 * Idempotency is layered, because Stripe retries on any non-2xx and may
 * deliver the same event more than once even after a success:
 *
 *   1. `stripe_events` — the event id is a primary key, so recording it IS
 *      the lock. ONLY a unique violation means "already claimed" (D-112);
 *      any other claim error is the database failing, and is answered 500 so
 *      Stripe delivers again — never 200, which would end retries for a
 *      payment nothing has granted.
 *   2. `unique (child_id, mission_id)` on mission_entitlements — a second
 *      grant is a no-op, and the access email goes only with the grant that
 *      actually inserted the row.
 *
 * A duplicate `checkout.session.completed` is RECONCILED rather than dropped
 * (D-112): it re-runs the same verified, idempotent path. A delivery that
 * already granted changes nothing; one whose earlier attempt failed after
 * claiming — and whose claim could not be released — still grants, instead
 * of being acknowledged forever as a duplicate. The duplicate path never
 * releases a claim: the claim may belong to a delivery still in flight.

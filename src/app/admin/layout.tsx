/**
 * THE INTERNAL ADMIN — CMS-01, extended by the LMS brief (§3, §18–§24).
 *
 * Still the simplest suitable mechanism (Tech Spec §39): forms over ordinary
 * Postgres tables. What the LMS brief added is breadth — nine destinations
 * instead of one — and the Mission Builder, which is authoring rather than
 * editing and is the reason D-56 was needed.
 *
 * Gated HERE and at the database. This layout refuses a non-admin before any
 * child route renders; every admin function additionally begins with
 * `is_admin()`, so a request that reached a server action directly would still
 * be refused. Neither is a substitute for the other.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a SaaS admin template (§26): same canvas, typefaces and
 * restraint as the Academy, because a tool used weekly should feel like the
 * product it edits.

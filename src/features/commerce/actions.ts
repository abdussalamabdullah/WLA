/**
 * Acquire a mission for a child.
 *
 * ONE action for free and paid. The browser submits a mission and a child and
 * nothing else — it does not say, and cannot say, how the mission should be
 * acquired. The server reads `is_free` from the mission row and routes
 * accordingly:
 *
 *   free  → entitlement granted directly, back to My Missions
 *   owned → nothing to do; back to My Missions, which says so
 *   paid  → Stripe Checkout, entitlement created by the verified webhook
 *           (or, if an earlier payment for it is awaiting the webhook, no
 *           second Checkout — back to My Missions to wait for it)
 *
 * The child is verified against the authenticated parent before either path
 * runs (`requireOwnedChild`), so a submitted id belonging to another family
 * reaches neither Stripe nor a free grant.

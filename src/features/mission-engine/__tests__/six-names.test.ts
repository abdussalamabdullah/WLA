/**
 * SIX NAMES — conformance to the ACADEMY BUILD BRIEF of 2026-09-27.
 *
 * Supersedes the v0.2 conformance suite. The mission changed shape: the
 * Concern selection is no longer collected, the trackers became confirmations
 * rather than inputs, and both text responses are gone.
 *
 * Two kinds of assertion, deliberately kept apart:
 *
 *   1. BEHAVIOUR — the real reducer and real navigation are driven over the
 *      graph below, which mirrors the v2 seed. These prove the engine does the
 *      right thing.
 *
 *   2. AUTHORED CONTENT — asserted against the seed FILE. These prove the copy
 *      the Brief marks "Show exactly" is present verbatim and that the wiring
 *      in the graph below has not drifted from the seed.
 *
 * Neither proves the database enforces anything. That was established by
 * executing the migrations and seeds against a real PostgreSQL cluster — see
 * docs/LIVE-VALIDATION.md.
